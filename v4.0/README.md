# NFT Dutch Auction with ERC20 Token Bids (Upgradable)

Smart contract for conducting an upgradable NFT Dutch Auction with bidding in ERC20 tokens.

## Introduction

`NFTDutchAuction_Upgradable.sol` allows a seller to auction a single NFT using the Dutch Auction mechanism, accepting bids in an ERC20 token (TUSD). The contract is upgradeable using UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) which allows for changes and additions to contract functionality. In a Dutch Auction, the price of the item starts high and decreases over time until a bidder accepts the current price. The NFT is transferred to the winning bidder, and the winning bid amount in TUSD tokens is transferred to the seller once the auction is finalized.

`TUSDFaucet.sol` is an ERC20 token contract that represents a Test USD token (TUSD) which can be minted for auction payment.

`NFTMinter.sol` is for minting NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) based on the ERC721 standard. It utilizes the OpenZeppelin library's `ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId` preset which provides built-in functionalities for minting, pausing, and automatically assigning token IDs. Initializes the NFTMinter with a name, symbol, and base token URI.

`NFTDutchAuction_Upgradable.sol` requires the seller to approve the auction contract to transfer the NFT on their behalf. It also requires bidders to approve the auction contract to transfer TUSD tokens on their behalf as bids.

## Key Features

- Upgradable smart contract using UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard).
- The auction is conducted for a single NFT, identified by its contract address and token ID.

## NFTDutchAuction_Upgradable Contract Methods

### initialize(uint256 _reservePrice, uint256 _numBlocksAuctionOpen, uint256 _offerPriceDecrement, address erc721TokenAddress, uint256 _nftTokenId, address erc20TokenAddress)
Initializes the auction with parameters. This replaces the constructor for upgradeable contracts.

```solidity
function initialize(
        uint256 _reservePrice,
        uint256 _numBlocksAuctionOpen,
        uint256 _offerPriceDecrement,
        address erc721TokenAddress,
        uint256 _nftTokenId,
        address erc20TokenAddress
) public initializer 
```

### bid(uint bidAmount)
Place a bid; must be greater than or equal to the current price. Bidders must approve the contract to spend TUSD tokens on their behalf before bidding.

```solidity
function bid(uint bidAmount) public payable isOpenning returns (address)
```
### currentPrice()
Returns the current price of the NFT based on the elapsed blocks since the start of the auction.

```solidity
function currentPrice() public view returns (uint256)
```
### finalize(uint256 finalAuctionPrice) internal

Finalizes the auction by transferring the final auction price in TUSD to the seller, marking the auction as ended, and transferring the NFT to the winning bidder. This function is called internally once a winning bid is found.

```solidity
function finalize(uint256 finalAuctionPrice) internal
```
### _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal
Internal method used for upgrade authorization. Only the owner can authorize upgrades.
```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override onlyOwner {}
```

## TUSDFaucet Contract method

### mint(address to, uint256 amount)

Mint TUSD tokens to the specified address.

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public
```
